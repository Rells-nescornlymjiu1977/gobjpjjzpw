Just got out of When Life Gives You Tangerines and man, my head is still spinning like a blender—no like a washing machine on spin cycle maybe? The theater was packed, and the guy behind kept whispering spoilers like some looper. Couldn't decide if the popping sound was gunshots in the   or popcorn in my mouth. Half the time I was dodging the light from people's phone screens—why even come to the theater if you're gonna text? Anyway,   was something else. Lemme try to piece this mess together.

Tangerines, why tangerines? Citrus was everywhere. One scene she’s handing out tangerines from her trenchcoat like she's a fruity arms dealer, and it’s hilarious and sad and just... I dunno, you know? Think it's supposed to be a metaphor or maybe just they overdid the prop budget on oranges. Ah, jeez my back aches today, the seats like stone slabs. Anyway, that moment when she breaks down in the grocery aisle with the oranges rolling everywhere—I felt that. Life is basically a fruit basket gone rogue. Can't even think straight...something like that.

> There was this part where the lighting was so dim, like mood dim for no particular reason, that and the sound of one million candy wrappers crinkling at once was an engulfing ocean of noise, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   through static.

You got this character, right, who just wants to hold everything together with pieces of tangerine peel. (Note to self: 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later and pause on the scene where she monologues to the fruit.) Her chats with the guy in the coffee shop were like, is this flirty? Are they having a moment over citrus-related puns? Who even writes that? I dig it. Wouldn’t mind 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this   again without some lady's hair blocking half the screen like a palm tree.

Someone else asked me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   for them, maybe just so I could explain this fever dream to them. Man, I hope they appreciate the effort, cause my head’s still unraveling like a ball of yarn. Can’t form sentences right now, still reeling. Tangerine roll through the cobbled streets. Life and fruit in a blender—metaphorically, not literally cause that’d be sticky.

function youKnowLife() {
    var oranges = [];
    while (bananas < tangerines) {
    // Just rolling with it now
    lemons.push(moreLemonade);
    }
    return citrusMeltdown;
} 

So, yeah, that's it. Gonna unfry my brain a bit.
